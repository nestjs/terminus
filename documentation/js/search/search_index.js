\n\nContributing to Nest\nWe would love for you to contribute to Nest and help make it even better than it is\ntoday! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:\n\nCode of Conduct\nQuestion or Problem?\nIssues and Bugs\nFeature Requests\nSubmission Guidelines\nCoding Rules\nCommit Message Guidelines\n\n\n\n Code of Conduct\nHelp us keep Nest open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct][coc]. -->\n\n Got a Question or Problem?\nDo not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on Stack Overflow where the questions should be tagged with tag nestjs.\nStack Overflow is a much better place to ask questions since:\n\n\nquestions and answers stay available for public viewing so your question / answer might help someone else\nStack Overflow's voting system assures that the best answers are prominently visible.\n\nTo save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general support and redirect people to Stack Overflow.\nIf you would like to chat about the question in real-time, you can reach out via our gitter channel.\n Found a Bug?\nIf you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by\nsubmitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Even better, you can\nsubmit a Pull Request with a fix.\n Missing a Feature?\nYou can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub\nRepository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with\na proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.\nPlease consider what kind of change it is:\n\nFor a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be\ndiscussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,\nand help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project. For your issue name, please prefix your proposal with [discussion], for example \"[discussion]: your feature idea\".\nSmall Features can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.\n\n Submission Guidelines\n Submitting an Issue\nBefore you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.\nWe want to fix all the issues as soon as possible, but before fixing a bug we need to reproduce and confirm it. In order to reproduce bugs we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using a repository or Gist. Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us wealth of important information without going back & forth to you with additional questions like:\n\nversion of NestJS used\n3rd-party libraries and their versions\nand most importantly - a use-case that fails\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, we are not able to investigate / fix bugs without a minimal reproduction, so if we don't hear back from you we are going to close an issue that don't have enough info to be reproduced.\nYou can file new issues by filling out our new issue form.\n Submitting a Pull Request (PR)\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\nSearch GitHub for an open or closed PR\nthat relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\nFork the nestjs/nest repo.\nMake your changes in a new git branch:\n  git checkout -b my-fix-branch master\nCreate your patch, including appropriate test cases.\n\nFollow our Coding Rules.\nRun the full Nest test suite, as described in the developer documentation,\nand ensure that all tests pass.\nCommit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our\ncommit message conventions. Adherence to these conventions\nis necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.\n  git commit -a Note: the optional commit -a command line option will automatically \"add\" and \"rm\" edited files.\n\nPush your branch to GitHub:\n git push origin my-fix-branch\nIn GitHub, send a pull request to nestjs:master.\n\nIf we suggest changes then:\n\nMake the required updates.\nRe-run the Nest test suites to ensure tests are still passing.\nRebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):\ngit rebase master -i\ngit push -f\n\n\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution!\nAfter your pull request is merged\nAfter your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes\nfrom the main (upstream) repository:\n\nDelete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:\n  git push origin --delete my-fix-branch\nCheck out the master branch:\n  git checkout master -f\nDelete the local branch:\n  git branch -D my-fix-branch\nUpdate your master with the latest upstream version:\n  git pull --ff upstream master\n\n Coding Rules\nTo ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:\n\nAll features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).\n\nAll public API methods must be documented. (Details TBC). -->\nWe follow Google's JavaScript Style Guide, but wrap all code at\n100 characters. An automated formatter is available, see\nDEVELOPER.md.\n\n Commit Message Guidelines\nWe have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to more\nreadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.  But also,\nwe use the git commit messages to generate the Nest change log.\nCommit Message Format\nEach commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer.  The header has a special\nformat that includes a type, a scope and a subject:\n(): \n\n\n\nThe header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.\nAny line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier\nto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.\nFooter should contain a closing reference to an issue if any.\nSamples: (even more samples)\ndocs(changelog) update change log to beta.5bugfix(@nestjs/core) need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js\n\nThe version in our package.json gets copied to the one we publish, and users need the latest of these.Revert\nIf the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert:, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: This reverts commit ., where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.\nType\nMust be one of the following:\n\nbuild: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)\nci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)\ndocs: Documentation only changes\nfeature: A new feature\nbugfix: A bug fix\nperf: A code change that improves performance\nrefactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\nstyle: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)\ntest: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\n\nSubject\nThe subject contains succinct description of the change:\n\nuse the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\"\ndon't capitalize first letter\nno dot (.) at the end\n\nBody\nJust as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\".\nThe body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.\nFooter\nThe footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to\nreference GitHub issues that this commit Closes.\nBreaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.\nA detailed explanation can be found in this document.\n Signing the CLA\n\nPlease sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before sending pull requests. For any code\nchanges to be accepted, the CLA must be signed.
